      <description>What is Cardano? Part One.   Cardano is a very innovative blockchain, founded in 2015 by one of the founders of Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson. The premiere of Cardano began in earnest in 2017. Cardano is a Blockchain based on the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. Contrary to Ethereum, which currently uses the Proof of Work mechanism. This means that you do not need huge amounts of electricity to confirm transactions, as is the case with Proof of Work.</description>
