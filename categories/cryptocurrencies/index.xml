      <description>What is Cardano? Part One.   Cardano is a very innovative blockchain, founded in 2015 by one of the founders of Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson. The premiere of Cardano began in earnest in 2017. Cardano is a Blockchain based on the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. Contrary to Ethereum, which currently uses the Proof of Work mechanism.
