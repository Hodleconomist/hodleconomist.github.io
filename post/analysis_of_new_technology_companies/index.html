<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Recently a survey was conducted among participants of investing channel on reddit. The original poster asked redditors to name technologies and companies worth investing in, for future growth and profits. Responses among reddit users are usually open ended and vague, however several technologies were named, such as: biotechnology and genome sequencing, microchip production, micro nuclear reactors, solid state batteries, quantum computing and others.</p>
<p>Also, several publicly traded companies were named and their trading ticker was provided. We decided to take a closer look at those companies, and see how can we quickly collect data on them.</p>

</br>

<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>The objective of this short study is to explore and gain basic understanding of the named entities from the survey, including quick revenue analysis with the help of automated data collection. Data in XBRL format is provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and allows to obtain relevant information on companies by means of an API. Stockrow web service also provides API to automatically download files in excel format, which can then be loaded into Python Pandas dataframe. Finally, the secondary goal of this study is to explore ways of information extraction from unstructured parts of company reports.
If you would like to obtain a full study with detail fundamental analysis, please get in touch with us by filling in the contact form.</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>In order to make this study as short as possible we decided to combine two sources of data - Stockrow and SEC. First a Python program was designed to collect financial quantitative data from Stockrow and qualitative data from SEC. SEC provides data in XBRL format, which is similar to XML. The obtained data has to be parsed and extracted in order to become human readable.
What is XBRL? XBRL is the open international standard for digital business reporting, managed by a global not for profit consortium, XBRL International.
The XBRL format provides a relatively simple way to extract structured data like financial positions from the income statement or a balance sheet. The problem arises when it comes to unstructured data of some parts of the SEC filing reports. Initial observation shows that each company uses different nodes for text block data. For example business description is reported in a XBRL text block as either:</p>
<ul>
<li>businessdescriptionandaccountingpoliciestextblock,</li>
<li>organizationconsolidationandpresentationoffinancialstatement&hellip;..,</li>
<li>or a company specific text block.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, a different approach has to be taken. We decided to collect the whole blocks of unstructured data in one place, and use Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to extract the relevant information. Python and Spacy.io framework was used for this purpose.</p>

<p>All of the Company’s assets, management and employees are located in the western United States.
The Company’s assets, which include uranium, vanadium and REE extraction, recovery, permitting, evaluation and exploration assets, are held directly and indirectly, as the case may be, by the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries Energy Fuels Holdings Corp. (“EF Holdings”) and Strathmore Minerals Corp. (“Strathmore”).
Energy Fuels is engaged in conventional and in situ recovery (“ISR”) uranium extraction and recovery, along with the exploration, permitting, and evaluation of uranium properties in the United States.
The Company also extracts and recovers vanadium from certain of its uranium projects, as market conditions warrant.
In 2021, the Company commenced its ramp-up to commercial production of rare earth element (“REE”) carbonate (“RE Carbonate”), another byproduct of the uranium recovery process, and is evaluating the potential to recover isotopes from its existing process streams needed for emerging targeted alpha therapy (“TAT”) cancer therapeutics.</p>
<p>In addition, Energy Fuels recovers uranium from other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional material, referred to as “Alternate Feed Materials,” at its Mill, thereby recycling materials back into the market that would otherwise be lost to direct disposal.
With its uranium, vanadium, REE and potentially radioisotope production, the Mill is quickly becoming a critical minerals hub for the U.S. Uranium, which is the fuel for carbon-free, emission-free baseload nuclear power, is one of the cleanest forms of energy in the world.
The REEs we are now producing are used for the manufacture of permanent magnets for electric vehicles, wind turbines and other clean energy and modern technologies, and the radioisotopes we are evaluating for recovery from our REE and uranium processing streams have the potential to provide the isotopes needed for emerging TAT cancer-fighting therapeutics.</p>

<p>Uranium Energy Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 16, 2003 under the name Carlin Gold Inc.
During 2004 we changed our business operations and focus from precious metals exploration to uranium exploration in the United States.
On January 24, 2005, we completed a reverse stock split of our common stock on the basis of one share for each two outstanding shares and amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Uranium Energy Corp.
Our fully-licensed and 100%-owned Hobson Processing Facility forms the basis for our regional operating strategy in the State of Texas, specifically in the South Texas Uranium Belt, where we utilize ISR mining.
We utilize a “hub-and-spoke” strategy whereby the Hobson Processing Facility acts as the central processing site (the “hub”) for our Palangana Mine and future satellite uranium mining activities, such as our Burke Hollow and Goliad Projects, located within the South Texas Uranium Belt (the “spokes”).
The Hobson Processing Facility has a physical capacity to process uranium-loaded resins up to a total of two million pounds of U3O8 annually and is licensed to process up to one million pounds of U3O8 annually. The Company is investing in building the next generation of low-cost and environmentally friendly uranium projects that will be competitive on a global basis.</p>

<p>Fig. 15. Graph presenting revenue of Aehr Test Systems
<img src="/img/14_sec_Aehr_Test_Systems.jpg" alt="Short description of Aehr Test Systems">
Source: Own study</p>
<p>Aehr Test was incorporated in the state of California on May 25, 1977.
We develop, manufacture and sell solutions that are designed to reduce the cost of testing and to perform reliability screening and stress testing, burn-in or cycling, of homogeneous and heterogenous logic and memory semiconductor integrated circuits, sensors, power and optical devices.
These solutions can be used to simultaneously perform parallel testing and burn-in of packaged devices, singulated bare die or semiconductor devices while still in wafer form.
The Company’s semiconductor test and reliability qualification solutions address multiple test and burn-in segments including silicon carbide devices for electric vehicles, silicon photonics markets that include data center infrastructure and worldwide 5G infrastructure, 2D/3D sensor markets related to consumer electronics and automotive applications, and the data storage and memory markets.</p>

</br>

<p>As can be seen from the above charts, most of the listed companies had rising revenues.
First group which included 10 out of 14 companies had raising revenues for two consecutive periods. The second group which included 2 companies had rising revenues in one period out of the last consecutive two. Only the last group which also included 2 companies had falling revenues for the last two periods.
This indicates that redditors chose rather solid high tech investments for their portfolios.</p>
<p>Retrieving data from Stockrow was a breeze. Apart from the paid API, the service provides an easy way to download company data as excel files which can later be stored and operated upon as a Python Pandas dataframe. For this study, both income statement and balance sheet positions for several years were downloaded and combined into a single dataframe. From there a revenue position for each year was obtained and presented as a graph.</p>
<p>Retrieving data from SEC EDGAR presents a more challenging task. Most financial positions from the income statement or balance sheet are easy to retreive as they have a clear name in XBRL language. However, parts of text which represent unstructured data, such as company descriptions or other important footnote disclosure are not assigned consistently to XBRL nodes. Various companies seem to assign the same text to different nodes, which makes it difficult not only to retrieve the information but also to asses whether such information was made available at all. Moreover, sometimes such information can be spread around and assigned to several different nodes. Due to this inconsistency in reporting, we have decided to take a different approach.</p>
<p>We used Natural Language Processing framework Spacy.io to extract the relevant information. For this purpose blocks of text from financial reports are first downloaded as simple text and tokenized. Next rule-base matching for required topics was applied. Since we only wanted to obtain company description, it was decided that the search will focus on tokenized company names. However, in the course of the study it turned out that it wasn&rsquo;t enough. A lot of text blocks with company description was missed, as some companies used &ldquo;We&rdquo; to describe its operations, others used &ldquo;The company&rdquo;. After accounting for those changes, we managed to come up with sufficiently good description for operations of the listed entities using Spacy.io rule-based matching.</p>

</br>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Automation of analysis with Python and its data mining ecosystem, makes it fun and simple to quickly gain basic understanding of many companies in short time frame. By using Stockrow&rsquo;s API we could quickly assess the state of finances of an analysed entity. By using Natural Language Processing, we were able to extract relevant background information from financial reports.</p>
<p>This approach can further be extended to facilitate obtaining information on other topics, such as company investments, technology, research and development, acquisitions in order to gain further insights into the inner workings of an entity.</p>
<p>In the course of the study, it became apparent that search for company description or other unstructured data with XBRL nodes cannot be relied upon. The names of those nodes are not used in consistent manner. By using SEC XBRL, it is difficult to asses if the information we are looking for was made available or whether it was split and placed under different node tags. For this reason we recommend using either NLP for text tokenization and extraction or even just regex, for simple text extraction.</p>
