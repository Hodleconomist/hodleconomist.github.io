<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This series of articles is made of three parts. In <b>part I</b> of this series we explored frequency word count for the most common words in Nvidia SEC filings.</p>
<p>In this part, which is <b>part II</b>, we are going a step further, and try to explore the most important sentences from the company&rsquo;s SEC filings.</p>
<p>The last <b>part III</b> of the series will explore comparison of SEC filing statements across different time periods and elimination of repeating sentences in order to narrow down the research.</p>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>The aim of this article is to employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to tokenize the text and extract all sentences containing certain phrases which should speed up the analysis considerably.</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>After extracting Nvidia&rsquo;s financial reports from SEC EDGAR repository, we proceeded with word tokenization of the text. The next step was to prepare specific phrases of interest to look for. In the final step, we extracted all sentences containing the required phrases and keywords.
A python program was written in order to automate the analysis. Only Item 1 and Item 7 of the Nvidia SEC filings were explored.
If you would like to obtain a report where the whole 10-K report is taken into account, please get in touch with us.</p>
<p>After several discussions and brainstorms with other analysts working with hi-tech companies, we have chosen the following phrases and keywords to be of relevance to the industry:</p>
<p>&lsquo;research and development&rsquo;,
&lsquo;merger and acquisitions&rsquo;,
&lsquo;customer&rsquo;,
&lsquo;competition&rsquo;,
&lsquo;innovation&rsquo;,
&lsquo;product portfolio&rsquo;,
&lsquo;patents&rsquo;,
&lsquo;pricing&rsquo;,
&lsquo;market share&rsquo;,
&lsquo;suppliers&rsquo;,
&lsquo;partners&rsquo;,
&lsquo;technology&rsquo;,&lsquo;technological&rsquo;,
&lsquo;technics&rsquo;, &lsquo;engineering&rsquo;,
&lsquo;operations&rsquo;,
&lsquo;collaborative arrangements&rsquo;</p>

<p>As can be seen from the table above, the number of sentences obtained is quite high. In addition, some of them repeat. <b>In the next part of this series, we are going to automatically eliminate repeating sentences, and compare them with the previous years. </b></p>
<p>In the current part, however, we are going to manually screen the sentences.
We decided to choose the most interesting, non repeatable or forward looking statements.</p>

<li>There are almost 3 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</br>

<b>Operations</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>According to the analysis, the number of sentences obtained by searching for predetermined phrases or keywords is still too high. Some of those sentences repeat and need to be eliminated. Also, some of those sentences were used in SEC filings for previous years, and they&rsquo;re way less meaningful then fresh statements in the report. Such sentences also need to be set lower in priority in order to facilitate the analysis.  That&rsquo;s the topic for the final part of this series of articles on Nvidia SEC filings analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Repeating sentences need to be eliminated. Comparison to previous years will refocus the analysis on more meaningful statements from the SEC filings.</p>
