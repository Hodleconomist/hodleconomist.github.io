<p>Part One.

<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>Cardano is a very innovative blockchain, founded in 2015 by one of the founders of Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson. The premiere of Cardano began in earnest in 2017.
Cardano is a Blockchain based on the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. Contrary to Ethereum, which currently uses the Proof of Work mechanism. This means that you do not need huge amounts of electricity to confirm transactions, as is the case with Proof of Work.</p>
<p>The development of the Cardano protocol is quite centralized and is currently overseen by the Cardano Foundation based in Zug, Switzerland. Centralization is not a disadvantage in this case, but rather an advantage, as it enables faster implementation of advanced concepts.</p>
<p>For example, Ethereum is also managed by the Ethereum Foundation. The difference is that the Ethereum Foundation is only part of a larger ecosystem made up of community developers, users, miners, hodlers, and other groups. The Cardano Foundation, on the other hand, works closely with companies such as IOHK and Emurgo to develop and promote the Cardano network.
This does not mean, of course, that the Cardano blockchain itself is centralized, but that its development is closely supervised by the Cardano Foundation. It should be noted, however, that Cardano has a very strong and rapidly growing community of passionate enthusiasts that are increasingly contributing to the development of the protocol.</p>
<h2 id="features-of-cardano">Features of Cardano</h2>
<p>The most important feature of Cardano is its very strong scientific foundations. Unlike Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum, who adopted a strategy of &ldquo;let&rsquo;s do something first, then we&rsquo;ll see if it works and how to improve it&rdquo;, Hoskinson adopted a different strategy. First, you need to conduct research and verify which assumptions have a strong scientific basis, and only then implement them in the form of a protocol. To this end, he hired a number of outstanding scientists from various fields of information technology and cryptography, who jointly published over 100 articles reviewed and published in the most significant journals and conferences for the field. This process is a kind of guarantee that the Cardano protocol has a very strong theoretical foundation, which is the foundation for the construction of the entire Blockchain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cardano is based on solid scientific research</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that it is huge and at the moment very underestimated added value for Cardano. It seems, however, that it will be appreciated when large financial and insurance institutions start trying to choose the blockchain, which will care about the certainty of
the transaction.</p>
<h2 id="currency">Currency</h2>
<p>The currency of the Cardano network is the ADA and fractions are denominated in Lovelace. However, this is not the only coin that is currently possible in the protocol. So-called Native Tokens are also supported. For comparison, in the Ethereum network, tokens are generated by smart contracts, in Cardano, smart contracts are not necessary to issue a token, which is why they are called Native Tokens, i.e. native tokens. They are built into the protocol. They can be used to easily emit NFTs without the need to use smart contracts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The currency of the Cardano network is ADA, Native Tokens are also possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As of today, Cardano does not have any commonly functioning smart contracts. However, they are already in the testing phase, and according to Charles Hoskinson&rsquo;s statements, they should appear on the mainnet in about 90 days.
Reports from many developers participating in the tests show that the first smart contracts have already been successfully made on the test network.</p>
<p>The Cardano Foundation is also heavily involved in training entire groups of new smart contract developers on Cardano. The main tool for creating smart contracts will be a framework called Plutus. Anyone interested can sign up for programming training in this framework. Over 1,000 programmers from all over the world participated in the first edition. The second edition of the Plutus workshops is currently underway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Smartcontracts in the final testing phase.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="wallets">Wallets</h2>
<p>Cardano currently has two main wallets, i.e. wallets. The first is a Daedalus wallet available for MacOS, Linux and Windows desktops. Note that this wallet is NOT available for mobile devices. Therefore, all applications in Google Play or the App Store that pretend to be Daedalus are malware.</p>
<p>Daedalusa should be downloaded only from the official website to which the link can be found on the official Cardano website at <a href="https://cardano.org/">https://cardano.org/</a></p>
<p>However, for mobile devices, the only official wallet is Yoroi wallet. It can be installed on iOS, Android or as a plug-in for popular web browsers such as Firefox, Edge, Chrome.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Daedalus is full-node. This means that this wallet downloads the entire blockchain copy to a local disk and connects directly to other nodes on the Cardano network. So it is one of the safest forms of connecting to Blockchain.
The Yoroi wallet is light-node. This means that this wallet must first connect to another full-node, for which it will get access to the rest of the network. As of today, Yoroi connects mainly with nodes managed by the Cardano Foundation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Daedalus wallet is full-node, which means that it downloads a full copy of the Blockchain to a local disk</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>As of the writing of this article, the functionality of the Cardano network is still quite limited compared to the Ethereum blockchain. However, this should not discourage those concerned, as the potential of this protocol is enormous. For example, compared to Bitcoin, this is a gulf in favor of Cardano. Today you can stake your own funds and thus achieve passive income, issue your own tokens, and issue NFT. Combined with low commissions and high transaction processing speed, this is a very interesting alternative to Ethereum. As soon as smart contracts appear, the Cardano blockchain will become a full-fledged competitor to Ethereum.</p>
<p>According to Charles Hoskinson&rsquo;s announcement, over 100 organizations operating in crypto have already announced the transfer or addition of their smart contracts from Ethereum to Cardano after the introduction of smart contracts. These include, among others: Celsius, SingularityNET, Ergo and many other well-known projects.</p>
<p>In the next article, we will take a closer look at some of the Cardano network issues covered in this section.</p>
